Festers. Everywhere. Armed mostly with gas-powered rock flingers.
At least 10 of them guarding the hangar door. Typical.

Could try punching my way through, or sneaking the long way to the 
Emergency Exit.

What should I do?
1. Take them head on - rush the 10 guards.
2. Sneak my way to the emergency exit.
